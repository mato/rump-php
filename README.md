# rump-php

## What is this?

PHP packaging and infrastructure for running as Unikernels atop
the Xen hypervisor, powered by [rumprun](http://repo.rumpkernel.org/rumprun)
and [Rump Kernels](http://rumpkernel.org).

Many thanks to Samuel Martin (@tSed) for developing patches to improve the
cross-compilation support for Nginx.

## Trying it out

_TODO: Update instructions for the php/nginx repository split_

To play with this, build rumprun for Xen according to the
[instructions](http://wiki.rumpkernel.org/Repo%3A-rumprun#xen) and add the
`app-tools` directory to your `$PATH`. 

You will also need to install:
* `genisoimage`, to build the data images for the domUs.

You will need a working Xen network set up, and two IP addresses for the demo.
One will be used by the Xen domU running the HTTP server, the other by the domU
running PHP serving FastCGI.

1. Edit `run_nginx.sh` and `run_php.sh`, replacing the IP addresses used as
   appropriate.
2. Edit `images/data/conf/nginx.conf` replacing the IP address in
   `fastcgi_pass` to match the IP you will use for the PHP domU.
3. Run `make` to build the Unikernels and data images.
4. As root on your Xen dom0, run `./run_nginx.sh` in one window and
   `./run_php.sh` in another.
5. Browse to http://_nginx domU_/.
